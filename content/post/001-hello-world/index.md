## This is the first blog post commemorating me finishing work on this template.

I've been thinking about getting a domain and making a landing website for quite a while now, also using the domain for mail, file hosting, etc; but could never pay enough effort where it was due.
Finally I was inspired by [haiiro](haiiro.moe) and reading about hugo made it seem like it's gonna be a 2 hour task max.
Let me tell you something, it wasn't.

Maybe the online comments were right, maybe hugo is simple for someone that is already familiar with frontend and static page generators but for me who knew nothing about these - the task took 4 full days of procrastinating on uni projects.
These whole go template thingies are kinda silly.

I have also yet to edit the styling itself so that i can actually work with some accent colors here and there, right now it's all very monochromatic.
But that will be in another post.

More specific info about the project can be found here: [projects](/projects/)->[chiihou](/projects/chiihou/).
