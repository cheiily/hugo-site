Hi, I'm cheily. 

I'm a \
• third-year 👨‍💻compsci👾 student in the game-dev specialization, \
• 🤼fighting⚔️game🕹️ enthusiast and TO for GBVS(R), \
• leisure 🀅riichi🀄mahjong🀆 player, \
• ⛩️animanga🌸 consumer, \
• 💿 CD 📀 collector & retro📼tech enjoyer. \
Other than that my hobbies include gaming (gacha too - HSR, Resleriana), cycling and ground tennis.

I've been dabbling with programming since as far back as middle school and it's been a hobby for a large part of my life, which then became my major and hopefully my job in the future :)

Here you'll find my projects and a personal blog about whatever i find worth mentioning. Kinda a middle ground between twitter and linkedin.
Unfortunately you won't find any game projects here as I don't have a whole lot in my sleeve yet, but I'm very actively working towards changing that! Look forward to these!
Go ahead and browse, feel free to reach out for any reason, project- or interest-related, or literally anything else (silly reasons encouraged!!)

## May your internet travels be 🥮🐉🀅 **fortuitous** 🀅🐉🥮!

If you're interested, *chiihou* (en. "Blessing of the earth") is a *yaku* (win condition, main point source) in riichi mahjong - it happens when you are not the dealer and your hand is completed on the first tile draw. It comes in pair with *tenhou* ("Blessing of heaven"), which happens when you are the dealer. Both are worth *yakuman* - one of the heighest scoring hands possible. \
I was not so much inspired by its mechanic as much as by its title - information technology, computers and digitalization in general are crazy feats of engineering only possible because of the limitless human ingenuity and centuries of inventions - all borne of humans, inhabitans of the earth. But perhaps the local *yaku* "Blessing of Man" would have been more fitting...
