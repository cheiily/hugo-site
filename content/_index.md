Hi! My name is Grzegorz, online I often go by the handle 'cheily'. \
I'm a student at the Technical University of Lodz (Politechnika Łódzka), with Applied Computer Science as my major, specializing in Computer Simulation and Games Technologies.

Programming has been my interest all the way back since middle school when I introduced myself to c++ and since then I've always been hacking something up in my free time, as a hobby - whether it be a custom Discord bot with JDA, a simple text-based Game of Life simulation or a minimal CLI flashcards tool. 

<ins>**On this website you will find most of my personal projects**</ins>, regardless of their state - some were finished and some were dropped. I believe it's important to learn from failures and be proud of the attempts. They were all started after I enlisted at the university. For each there is a short summary on the taxonomy page and an extended description in their own article.

The course has had me use a number of different languages and frameworks, which in turn only increased my curiosity to try out more, that were not required in the curriculum. All in all they include:
