Hi, I'm cheily. 

I'm a \
• third-year 👨‍💻compsci👾 student, \
• ⛩️animanga🌸 consumer, \
• leisure 🀅riichi🀄mahjong🀆 player, \
• 🤼fighting⚔️game🕹️ enthusiast and TO for GBVS(R) (no i don't play GBF and I won't).

I occasionally try to write some tools that should prove helpful to at least me, but god bless if i can work on them for longer than a couple weeks. Uni sucks sometimes.

Here you'll find my projects and a personal blog about whatever i find worth mentioning publicly (not a lot). Kinda a middle ground between twitter and linkedin.
Go ahead and browse, feel free to reach out for any reason (silly reasons encouraged)!

Note: this website is still under construction so things may break, be empty, etc.

## May your internet travels be 🥮🐉🀅 **fortuitous** 🀅🐉🥮!
