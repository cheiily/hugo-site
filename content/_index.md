Hi! My name is Grzegorz, online I often go by the handle 'cheily'. \
I'm a student at the Technical University of Lodz (Politechnika Łódzka), with Applied Computer Science as my major, specializing in Computer Simulation and Games Technologies.

Programming has been my interest all the way back since middle school when I introduced myself to c++ and since then I've always been hacking something up in my free time, as a hobby - whether it be a custom Discord bot with JDA, a simple text-based Game of Life simulation or a minimal CLI flashcards tool. 

<ins>**On this website you will find a selection of my personal projects**</ins>, all done after I joined the university. For each there is a short summary on the taxonomy page and an extended description in their own article. None of them are game projects (despite my specialization), but I'm actively working on a number of them right now and they will definitely find their place here in the future.

The course has had me use a number of different languages and frameworks, which in turn only increased my curiosity to try out more, that were not required in the curriculum. All in all they include:
