Hi, I'm cheily. 

I'm a \
• third-year 👨‍💻compsci👾 student in the game-dev specialization, \
• 🤼fighting⚔️game🕹️ enthusiast and TO for GBVS(R), \
• leisure 🀅riichi🀄mahjong🀆 player, \
• ⛩️animanga🌸 consumer, \
• 💿 CD 📀 collector & retro📼tech enjoyer. \
Other than that my hobbies include gaming (gacha too - HSR, Resleriana), cycling and ground tennis.

I've been dabbling with programming since as far back as middle school and it's been a hobby for a large part of my life, which then became my major and hopefully my job in the future :)

<ins>**Here you'll find a list of my projects**</ins> and a rather empty personal blog for whenever I find something worth sharing with the world. \
Unfortunately you won't find any game projects as I don't have a whole lot in my sleeve yet, but I'm very actively working to change that! Look forward to these! \
Go ahead and browse, feel free to reach out for any reason, project- or interest-related, or literally anything else (*silly reasons encouraged!!*)

## May your internet travels be 🥮🐉🀅 **fortuitous** 🀅🐉🥮!

If you're interested, *chiihou* (en. "Blessing of the earth") is a *yaku* (win condition, main point source) in riichi mahjong - it happens when you are not the dealer and your hand is completed on the first tile draw. It comes in pair with *tenhou* ("Blessing of heaven"), which happens when you are the dealer. Both are worth *yakuman* - one of the heighest scoring hands possible. \
I was not so much inspired by its mechanic as much as by its title - information technology, computers and digitalization in general are crazy feats of engineering only possible because of the limitless human ingenuity and centuries of inventions - all borne of humans, inhabitans of the earth. But perhaps the local *yaku* "Blessing of Man" would have been more fitting...
