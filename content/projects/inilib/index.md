## /motivation

First real jab at a 'personal project', inspired by a uni task requiring us to parse data from a chosen text format.
Also first time using a testing framework.

## /technologies

- C++17
- Boost
- Cmake

## /implementation

The project uses an organized sample-based testing layout. The output structure is organized into a map-based section tree with string entries.
Smart pointers are used to manage the memory and lifetimes of each tree node.

## /conclusions

The core feature of the tool was realized and is fully functional - the tool correctly parses the base ini format and turns it into a functional, traversable tree.
Unfortunately distracted by the increasingly busy semester plan as well as the release of Elden Ring :), the other planned features were left unimplemented.
