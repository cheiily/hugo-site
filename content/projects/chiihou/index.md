## /motivation

An idea of a personal landing/resume website has been going around my head for a while but the final push was seeing a befriended developer's small, personal blog built with Hugo. This introduced me to the whole concept of static website generators. \
As a form of procrastination from uni work, first came the website's layout and much later the content.

## /technologies

- Hugo
- VPS

## /implementation

Hugo utilizes Go templates for (partial) layout specifications and allows for easy import of pre-defined themes.
It offers a number of useful generation features such as archetypes, taxonomies, partials. It's really nice how you can import a theme and later override a specific part of it to match your own vision and needs.

## /conclusions

This website has proven a nice break for my mind during the extremely busy time of the last autumn-winter semester, while also a place for organizing my projects and a piece of self-presentation. I'm rather content with how it worked out but with time I came to dislike the theme i chose more and more, so maybe I'll change it some time soon...?
