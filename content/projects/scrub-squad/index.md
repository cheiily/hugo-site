## /motivation

This was the submission to the 2024 ZTGK contest in the Game Development category, which requries the games to be made on their own, dedicated engine.
The contest was also required for us to submit to as part of our coursework. \
We qualifed as the finialists in the contest.

## /technologies

- OpenGL
- Assimp
- ImGui (engine-only)
- Tracy profiler
- SDL (audio module only)

## /implementation

As dictated by the course, our game ideas had to incorporate in them a couple of randomly selected topics.
Ours, after discussion and some prototyping led us to a small, bathroom-themed RTS with a main objective of finding and recovering deposits of (laundry-themed) ore.

Within the 5-person team, I was one of the programmers and was mainly responsible for:
- the UI system & UI interactions
- the signal queue (engine)
- in-game item & equipment logic as well as concrete item implementations
- large parts of the combat & item-usage logic
- unit/tile selection & tile highlighting
- etc...

## /conclusions

This was easily the largest project I have yet taken part in, with the largest amount of work hours and effort put into it and so despite a number of its shortcomings, which mostly resulted from still lacking work-hours to be put into polishing the game, mine and the team's general conclusion was that we were quite proud of the game we had created. Of course there's lessons to be learnt, mostly about managing time and work, in-team communications, feature design and development planning as required by the deadlines, etc. We still did our best to make the game deliver to its promises and it a fully playable product with a functional core loop that you can experience, play and finish. \
All in all it was a very fun, albeit extremely busy semester, but I hope I can take part in projects of similar scale in the future :)
