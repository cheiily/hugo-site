-> Minimal discord chatbot application providing utility for a local FGC server. \
-> Built with the JDA5 discord API wrapper. \
-> Allows pin-management for thread-owners within event- and advice-forums. \
-> Integrates with [Dustgrain](/projects/dustgrain) for easy data lookup straight from discord. \
-> Provides a functional base for future expansion if necessary.
